It estimates what bacteria are in a sample and measures their relative abundance.</p> <p>Shotgun Metagenomics Sequencing: This method sequences extracted DNA directly from a sample without PCR amplification. It can identify multiple genes, allowing the evaluation of taxonomic composition and functional gene categories in the microbiome (e.g., amino acid synthesis, vitamin production, carbohydrate metabolism). It may also identify other microbes like virus, fungi, and archaea, etc. The amount of information gained depends heavily on sequencing depth (shallow or deep) and sample complexity.</p> <p>Taxonomy Resolution</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: Exclusively targets bacteria. Provides an overview of bacterial communities up to the genus level, and limited species resolution. PCR amplification can introduce bias, as certain primers preferentially amplify specific bacterial groups, artificially overestimating the true abundance of some.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Delivers resolution at the species and strain levels. Provides broader profiling, covering bacteria, viruses, and fungi, etc. The level of microbial information depends on sequencing depth, with deeper sequencing yielding more detailed insights.</li> </ul> <p>Functional Profiling</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: Provides bacterial taxonomic information but does not reveal bacterial function information.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Gives information on the functional genes, which is useful for understanding their roles and interactions (e.g., synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, carbohydrate) within the microbial community.</li> </ul> <p>Cost per Sample</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: Generally more cost-effective per sample. It reduces the amount of the sequencing needed compared to Shotgun Metagenomics and requires fewer resources for both sequencing and data analysis.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Generates more data and requires powerful computers to analyze, making it more costly and complex. Shallow or deep shotgun sequencing can be used depending on the investigational interest, with cost increasing as depth increases.</li> </ul> <p>Sample Selection</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: Applicable to all sample types. It is commonly used for fecal samples. It works better with lower microbial populations, such as skin and oral swabs.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Applicable to all sample types. More applicable to samples that contain more microbes than host cells (eg, feces). With samples that have a lot of host DNA like skin and oral swabs, a deeper sequence is needed to capture more microbial information.</li> </ul> <p>DNA Requirement</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: Being PCR-based, it has targeted DNA amplicons and requires minimal DNA input, often yielding successful results with less than 1 ng of DNA.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Typically requires higher DNA input (e.g., 1 ng/\u00b5L) due to sequencing of unamplified DNA content which can contains other DNAs are not only from bacteria (e.g., host DNA).</li> </ul> <p>Host DNA Interference</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA: This method avoids host DNA interference by selectively amplifying the bacterial 16S gene region through PCR, leaving out non-target DNA.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomics: Host DNA can impact data since higher amounts of host DNA reduce the microbial DNA signal. The host DNA can further be removed through data analysis.</li> </ul> <p>In summary:</p> <ul> <li>16S rRNA Sequencing: Focuses on amplifying and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene found in bacteria, making it an efficient and cost-effective way to identify bacterial taxa down to the genus level. Its single-gene focus means it can quickly process many samples, though it does not provide information about bacterial functions or detect non-bacterial organisms, which limits its ability to describe the broader microbial community.</li> <li>Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing: DNA in a sample is sequenced, which can reveal a picture of various microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as their potential functions. While this can offer a deeper look into microbial roles and interactions, it requires more resources, generates large datasets, and needs longer time to analyze, especially for large sample sizes.</li> </ul> <p>Something to Keep in Mind:</p> <ul> <li>Sequencing provides valuable insights into microbial diversity and genetic potential, but it primarily yields relative abundance data, which can be skewed by amplification and sequencing biases. Quantitative methods, like qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction), address these limitations by providing absolute measurements, helping to validate sequencing results, and ensuring that observed patterns reflect biological quantities. This combination of sequencing with quantitative methods strengthens the accuracy and reliability of microbial analyses, especially when interpreting microbial community dynamics and functional roles.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"alpha_div/","title":"Alpha Diversity","text":"<p>Another metric to measure microbiome diversity is alpha diversity, which measures the diversity within samples. For example, alpha diversity can describe the species diversity within a single community or sample. It provides information about how diverse or rich the microbial community is within each sample.</p> <p></p> Figure 1: Alpha diversity metrics for group 1 and group 2. Both groups were significantly different in all alpha-diversity variables. (A) The Shannon index reflects the evenness and richness within samples, while (B) Observed Features and (C) Chao1 evaluate the richness within samples. The Shannon index, Observed features, and Chao1 were significantly increased in group 1 compared to group 2, indicating a higher richness and evenness of species within the samples of group 1 (Shannon p=0.0022, Observed features p=0.0011, Chao1 p=0.0012). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare alpha diversity parameters between group 1 and 2.  <p>Alpha diversity, or diversity within samples, was significantly different in all alpha-diversity variables between group 1 and group 2 (Figure 1). Three different metrics were used to assess alpha diversity, each providing slightly different information. The Shannon index is an alpha diversity index that reflects both richness and evenness within the samples. Richness is defined as the total number of different species present in a sample (number of different species). A high richness indicates the abundance of many different species within a sample. Evenness describes how evenly distributed the abundance of those species within a sample is (equality of different species abundance). A high evenness reflects that most species are present in an equal abundance. Whereas a low evenness shows that a few species are more abundant than others. The Shannon index was significantly increased in group 1 compared to group 2, indicating an increased richness and evenness in group 1 (Shannon p=0.0022). Observed features is another metric to evaluate alpha diversity. It refers to the number of different species that are detected and counted within a sample, reflecting species richness. Chao1 is also a metric that evaluates species richness in alpha diversity. In contrast to Observed features it is a statistical estimator used to estimate the total species richness within a sample. It is particularly useful when low-abundant species are present that might be missed in a typical analysis. Observed features is a direct count of detected species, while Chao1 attempts to estimate the total richness by accounting for potentially missed rare species. Observed features and Chao1 were significantly increased in group 1 compared to group 2, indicating an increase in species richness in group 1 (Observed features p=0.0011, Chao1 p=0.0012).</p>"},{"location":"beta_div/","title":"Beta Diversity","text":"<p>Beta diversity is a metric used to measure the microbiome diversity between different samples or groups.
