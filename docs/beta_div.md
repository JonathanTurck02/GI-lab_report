# Beta Diversity
*Beta diversity is a metric used to measure the microbiome diversity between different samples or groups.  It provides information about how similar or different the microbial communities are between the different groups.*

Figure 2: Principal coordinate analysis (<i>PCoA</i>) plot based on the Bray-Curtis beta diversity measure, depicting relatedness of microbiome composition between samples. Statistical analysis is shown in Table 1. The <i>PCoA</i> plot reveals some clustering between group 1 and group 2 with substantial overlap, suggesting a shift in composition in a subset of individuals in group 2.

Figure 2 presents the Beta diversity based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. This clustering suggests some differences in the microbial composition between the two groups. Substantial overlap is observed in the clustering and a subset of group 2 clusters away from group 1. According to ANOSIM test, no difference (R=-0.058, 0.85) were found between group 1 and 2 in their microbial composition (Table 1).

Table 1: Statistics for beta diversity based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric. The ANOSIM (<i>Analysis of Similarities</i>) results indicate an R-value of -0.058 (a measure of group distinction between -1 and 1), with an adjusted p-value of 0.85, suggesting no significant separation between group 1 and group 2.
