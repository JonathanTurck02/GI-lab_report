## Aims
This study aimed to assess the differences between the fecal microbiome of group 1 and 2.

## Abstract
The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the probiotic PLC-003 on the fecal microbiome of dogs. Shotgun sequencing with QIIME2 alpha and beta diversity analysis was performed. Differential abundance testing was performed in R using ANCOMBC and MaAslin2 methods. No significant differences in the overall microbiome composition, richness, or evenness over time were observed in the control group. In the treatment group, only minor changes were revealed. No major differences in the alpha or beta diversity over time or compared to the control group were demonstrated. However, differential abundance testing revealed an increase in probiotic linked bacteria, particularly Bacillales and Weizmannia, in the probiotic-treated group over time and compared to the control group. This suggests that PLC-003 may promote the growth of beneficial bacterial populations previously described as probiotics in human studies. Overall, these findings are in accordance with previous studies and indicate a limited effect of the tested probiotic on the fecal microbiome in dogs.
